[![Build Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/apache-airavata-django-portal/badge/?version=latest)](https://apache-airavata-django-portal.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)

The Airavata Django Portal is a web interface to the
[Apache Airavata](http://airavata.apache.org/) API implemented using the Django
web framework. The intention is that the Airavata Django Portal can be used as
is for a full featured web based science gateway but it can also be customized
through various plugins to add more domain specific functionality as needed.

## Getting Started

The following steps will help you quickly get started with running the Airavata
Django Portal locally. This will allow you to try it out and can also be used as
a development environment. If you just want to run the Airavata Django Portal
locally, see the Docker instructions below for a more simplified approach.

The Airavata Django Portal works with Python versions 3.6 - 3.10. You'll need
one of these versions installed locally.

You'll also need Node.js and yarn to build the JavaScript frontend code. Please
install Node.js version 19. You
can also use [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to manage the Node.js install.
If you have nvm installed you can run `nvm install && nvm use` before running
any yarn commands. See
[the Yarn package manager](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/) for information
on how to install Yarn 1 (Classic).

This project uses [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for Python dependency
management. The portal has **no database** — there is nothing to migrate, and
all persistence goes through the Airavata gRPC API and the cache.

1.  Check out the project and install dependencies.

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/apache/airavata-django-portal.git
    cd airavata-django-portal
    uv sync
    ```

    `uv sync` creates `.venv/` (Python 3.12) and installs everything, including
    the editable `airavata-python-sdk` from a sibling `apache/airavata` checkout
    (see `[tool.uv.sources]` in `pyproject.toml`). Prefix commands with
    `uv run` (e.g. `uv run python manage.py ...`) or activate `.venv` directly.

2.  Create a local settings file by copying the sample and editing it to match
    your Keycloak and Airavata server deployment.

    ```
    cp django_airavata/settings_local.py.sample django_airavata/settings_local.py
    ```

3.  Build the JavaScript sources. There are a few JavaScript packages in the
    source tree, colocated with the Django apps in which they are used. The
    `build_js.sh` script will build them all.

    ```
    ./build_js.sh
    ```

    - **Windows note**: on Windows, run `.\build_js.bat` instead

4.  Run the server.

    ```
    uv run python manage.py runserver
    ```

5.  Point your browser to http://localhost:8000.

## Docker instructions

To run the Django Portal as a Docker container, you need a `settings_local.py`
file which you can create from the `settings_local.py.sample` file. Then run the
following:

1. Build the Docker image.

   ```
   docker build -t airavata-django-portal .
   ```

2. Run the Docker container.

   ```
   docker run -d \
     -v /path/to/my/settings_local.py:/code/django_airavata/settings_local.py \
     -p 8000:8000 airavata-django-portal
   ```

3. Point your browser to http://localhost:8000.

### Multi-architecture images

To build and push
[multi-architecture images](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/multi-arch/), first
create a builder (one time)

```
docker buildx create --name mybuilder --use
```

then run

```
docker buildx build --pull --platform linux/amd64,linux/arm64 -t apache/airavata-django-portal:latest --push .
```

## Documentation

Documentation currently is available at
https://apache-airavata-django-portal.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ (built from the
'docs' directory).

To build the documentation locally, first
[set up a development environment](#setting-up-development-environment), then
run the following in the root of the project:

```
mkdocs serve
```

## Feedback

Please send feedback to the mailing list at <dev@airavata.apache.org>. If you
encounter bugs or would like to request a new feature you can do so in the
[Airavata Jira project](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/AIRAVATA) (just
select the _Django Portal_ component when you make your issue).

## Customization

See the Customization Guide in the
[documentation](https://apache-airavata-django-portal.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
for information on how to customize the Airavata Django Portal user interface.
To get started we recommend going through the
[Gateways Tutorial](https://apache-airavata-django-portal.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial/gateways_tutorial/).
This tutorial covers the different ways that the user interface can be
customized.

## Contributing

For general information on how to contribute, please see the
[Get Involved](http://airavata.apache.org/get-involved.html) section of the
Apache Airavata website.

### Setting up development environment

`uv sync` installs the development and testing tools (ruff, ty) alongside the
runtime dependencies. Lint, format, and type-check the Python code with:

```
uv run ruff check .       # lint
uv run ruff format .      # auto-format
uv run ty check           # type check
```

Prettier and ESLint are used for JavaScript and Vue.js code (see `lint_js.sh`).

See the docs for more information on
[developing the backend](./docs/dev/developing_backend.md) and
[frontend code](./docs/dev/developing_frontend.md).

### Running Django Tests

Run `uv run ./runtests.py` to run the Django unit tests.
