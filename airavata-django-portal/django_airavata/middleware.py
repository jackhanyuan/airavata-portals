    """Attach the gRPC ``AiravataClient`` as ``request.airavata``.

    ``request.airavata`` is a lazy object: the client (and the ``airavata_sdk``
    import) is built only when a view first accesses it, carrying the user's
    Keycloak token from ``request.authz_token``. The channel is closed after the
    response if it was used. Views that never touch ``request.airavata`` incur no
    cost and do not require the SDK to be importable.

    Usage in a view::

        experiments = request.airavata.research.get_user_experiments(
            gateway_id=settings.GATEWAY_ID, user_name=request.user.username)
